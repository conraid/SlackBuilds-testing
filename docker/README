docker (manager for applications in Linux containers)

Docker is an open-source project to easily create lightweight,
portable, self-sufficient containers from any application.  The same
container that a developer builds and tests on a laptop can run at
scale, in production, on VMs, bare metal, OpenStack clusters, public
clouds and more.

HOME: https://www.docker.com/products/container-runtime

======================================================================
NOTE: 


To have the docker daemon start and stop with your host,
add to /etc/rc.d/rc.local:

  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.docker ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.docker start
  fi

and to /etc/rc.d/rc.local_shutdown (creating it if needed):

  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.docker ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.docker stop
  fi

If you are interested in enabling cgroup memory resource control over
swap as well, then append "swapaccount=1" to your kernel's parameters.
This is often in /etc/lilo.conf, on the "append" variable.

NOTE: google-go-lang is only needed at compile time - not needed for
runtime.

Docker doesn't support x86, only x86_64.

REQUIRES: go docker-proxy tini libseccomp
